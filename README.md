# Chat History Displayer

## About

 The ChatHistoryDisplayer consists of two parts: the server, which is being developed as an API, and the front-end, which tests the API. The server is situated in the `emulator` directory, while the front-end is situated in the `frontEndSimulator` directory. The mission of the API is to be integrated into the OnTrack platform.

## Present

### Demonstrative Video

A demonstrative video exists, you can find it [inside of the repository](media/demonstration.mp4) or [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YQ2wFPsoNcA). It showcases how to spin up `chathistorydisplayer-api` and `chathistorydisplayer-web`. It also explains some of the important files in both of the applications involved in this repository.

## Future

It is important that focus is kept on the ultimate goal: the integration into the OnTrack platform.

A [diagram of chathistorydisplayer-api integrated into the OnTrack platform](media/api-proposition.png) is a good artefact to look at, in terms of the future of this repository.
